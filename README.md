# hello-world
First Repository
My name is Jacob Wilkinson. I am a undergraduate student at the University of Nevada, Reno. I enjoy coding, baseball, food, video games, weight training and relaxing. 

I hope to use GitHub to create new projects with version control so that I have some work to show interviewers when it comes time to apply for internships and job opportunities.
